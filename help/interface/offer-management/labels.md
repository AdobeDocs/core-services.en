# Labels{#labels}

Create and manage labels that you can use to organize offers.

## Labels {#topic_65F3A7091A7D4F61B1FEFFEC6DE107C9}

Create and manage labels that you can use to organize offers. 

You can add one or more labels to each offer that is created. Labels serve two purposes:

* Make it easier to keep your offers organized. For example, you could label your Black Friday offers with the Black Friday label. You can then use the search functionality on the main page to easily locate all of the offers with that label. 
* Select offers in bulk when creating an offer activity. When you insert an offer activity in an email campaign, you can include offers based on their label. Instead of selecting offers individually, you can include all offers with label 'Black Friday'.

On the Labels tab, you can create, edit, and manage labels.
