An overview of Offer Management, how to access it, and how to grant user permissions.

## Adobe Offer Management {#section_07CBD4C01F4049A5A19781737D2DCD35}

The Offer Management core service provides offer creation, management, and decisioning across all channels in the Experience Cloud. It serves as a central offer catalog where you can associate eligibility rules and multiple pieces of content with each offer 'object', publish those offers across channels and locations, and serve the best offer for each customer at each interaction. These features enable you to continuously deliver the best offer to your customers in a way that's consistent and coordinated across their experience.

Benefits include:

* Improved e-mail campaign performance by delivering more personalized offers in your emails. 
* Improved workflow: Instead of creating multiple deliveries or campaigns, marketing teams can improve the workflow by creating a single delivery and vary the offers in different parts of the template. 
* Enables you to create, manage, and approve offers outside of the Adobe Campaign Standard e-mail campaign workflow. 
* Control over the number of times an offer is shown across e-mail campaigns and customers.

## Accessing Offers {#task_DEB6F6A4B6E04E15AD3E1817D700688E}

Learn how to access Offer Management.

1. Contact Adobe for provisioning.

   An Experience Cloud organization must have an instance of Campaign Standard. Adobe can also enable a feature in Campaign that lets you create offer activities within e-mails. 

1. From the Experience Cloud navigation menu, click the solution selector, then click **[!UICONTROL Offers]**.

   To access Offers in Campaign Standard, click the **[!UICONTROL Offers]** icon within an email template.

   Once you see both of these items in the Marketing Cloud, and within your Adobe Campaign account, you have been setup with the necessary functionality to get started. 

## Users and Permissions {#concept_81F0ABB07ACC49E099EDCD87AA0436E1}

Administrators can add users to Offer Management in the Admin Console. An email invitation is sent to the new user with instructions on accessing the product. Once a user is added, you can adjust their permissions, giving them access to different functionalities throughout Offer Management.

For more information ion using the Admin Console, see the [HelpX Admin Console documentation](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/help/aedash.html).

In Campaign, standard users automatically have the right to embed offer activities in an email template.

>[!NOTE]
>
>For beta, there are no permissions in place. Every user that has been added to Offers will have full access to all functionality within Offer Management.
