An *organization* is the entity that enables an administrator to configure groups and users, and to control single sign-on in the Experience Cloud. The organization functions like a log-in company that spans all the Experience Cloud products and solutions. Most often, an organization is your company name.

Short Description

An *organization* is the entity that enables an administrator to configure groups and users, and to control single sign-on in the Experience Cloud. The organization functions like a log-in company that spans all the Experience Cloud products and solutions. Most often, an organization is your company name. However, a company can have many organizations. 

Also, you might need to locate your organization ID for support purposes. You can verify that you are in the correct organization, or switch between organizations, using the **[!UICONTROL Organization]** menu.
