# Browser support in Experience Cloud {#browser}

For the best performance, Experience Cloud is optimized for the most popular browsers, including the latest version, plus the two previous versions.

* Chrome
* Edge
* Firefox
* Opera
* Safari

If your browser is not listed, it may still be supported, but it is recommended that you use one of the listed browsers. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>Not all applications running on Experience Cloud domain support all browsers. If you're unsure, check the documentation of a specific application.

## Language support in Experience Cloud {#languages}

Experience Cloud supports preferred languages for each user, as well as a secondary language. 

To view supported languages:

1. In Experience Cloud, click **[!UICONTROL Profile]** > [Preferences](https://experience.adobe.com/preferences).

1. Under **[!UICONTROL Profile]**, click the language link.

1. On **[!UICONTROL Select language]**, select a language from the **[!UICONTROL First language]** menu.

    While all application teams are committed to global language support, not all applications are offered in all languages noted above. If your primary language is not supported in an Experience Cloud application, you can also set a secondary language to default to when applicable.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
