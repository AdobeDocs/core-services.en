 1. To un-share a folder, click **[!UICONTROL Share Using Creative Cloud]** (similar to [Step 3](../experience-cloud-assets/t-share-creative-cloud.md#step_BA17CFA185284641A9B878BA29551996)), then remove users by clicking X, then click **[!UICONTROL Share]**.

   Once you have removed all Creative Cloud Users, the folder is un-shared and the Creative Cloud users no longer has access. 

Additional ways to use a shared asset include: 

* Use assets in the [!UICONTROL Asset Selector] in [!DNL Adobe Social] for social posts.
* Load or swap assets in the [Offers Library](https://docs.adobe.com/help/en/target/using/experiences/offers/manage-content.html) in [!DNL Adobe Target] for images in activities.

After you share a folder to the Creative Cloud, you will see the Creative Cloud logo on the folder.
