# Experience Cloud Central Interface Components Guide

[Experience Cloud](https://experience.adobe.com) is Adobe's integrated family of digital marketing applications, products, and services. From its intuitive interface, you can quickly access your cloud applications, product features, and services.

![Experience Cloud](assets/landing.png)

From Experience Cloud's header, you can:

* Access your applications and services
* Search for product documentation, tutorials, and community posts
* Globally search business objects using a global search (Experience Platform users only)
* Manage your account preferences (alerts, notifications, and subscriptions)

## Sign in to Experience Cloud {#signin}

Sign in and verify that you are in the right [organization](organizations.md).

1. Navigate to [Adobe Experience Cloud](https://experience.adobe.com).
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Sign in with an Adobe ID]**.
1. Verify that you are in the right organization.

    ![](assets/organizations-menu.png)

    **Verify your organization**

    To verify that you have logged in to your correct [organization](organizations.md), click on your profile avatar to see organization name. If you have access to more than one organization, you can also view and switch to another organization right in the header bar. 

    If your organization uses Federated IDs, Experience Cloud allows you to sign in with your organization's single sign-on without the need to enter your email address and password. To do this, add `#/sso:@domain` to the Experience Cloud URL (`https://experience.adobe.com`). 
    
    For example, for an organization with Federated IDs and the domain `adobecustomer.com`, set your URL link to `https://experience.adobe.com/#/sso:@adobecustomer.com`. You can also go directly to a specific application by bookmarking this URL, appended with the application path. (For example, for Adobe Analytics, `https://experience.adobe.com/#/sso:@adobecustomer.com/analytics`.)

## Access Experience Cloud applications {#navigation}

After signing in to Experience Cloud, you can quickly access all your applications, services, and organizations from the unified header.

To access Experience Cloud applications and services provisioned for you within your organization, go the application selector ![](assets/menu-icon.png).

## Browser support in Experience Cloud {#browser}

For the best performance, Experience Cloud is optimized for the most popular browsers, including the latest version, plus the two previous versions.

* Chrome
* Edge
* Firefox
* Opera
* Safari

If your browser is not listed, it may still be supported, but it is recommended that you use one of the listed browsers. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>Not all applications running on Experience Cloud domain support all browsers. If you're unsure, check the documentation of a specific application.

## Language support in Experience Cloud {#languages}

Experience Cloud supports preferred languages for each user, as set in your Adobe user account preferences. Supported languages currently are: 

* Chinese
* English
* French
* German
* Italian
* Japanese
* Korean
* Portuguese

While all application team are committed to global language support, not all applications are offered in all languages noted above. If your primary language is not supported in an Experience Cloud application, you can also set a secondary language to default to when applicable. This can be done in [Experience Cloud user preferences](https://experience.adobe.com/preferences).

## Get help and support {#support}

You can also submit open-ended feedback and create prioritized support tickets.

The [!UICONTROL Help] menu also gives you access to:

* **[!UICONTROL Support]:** Create a support ticket or contact [!UICONTROL Support] using Twitter.
