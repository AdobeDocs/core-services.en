# Experience Cloud central interface overview

[Experience Cloud](https://experience.adobe.com) is Adobe's integrated family of digital marketing applications, products, and services. From its intuitive interface, you can quickly access your cloud applications, product features, and services.

From Experience Cloud's header, you can:

* Access all your Experience Cloud applications and services
* From the Help menu, search for product documentation, tutorials, and community posts. View results in Experience League.
* Globally search business objects using a global search (Experience Platform users only) in the Search field.
* Manage your account [preferences](features/account-preferences.md) (alerts, notifications, and subscriptions)

   **Verify your organization**

   The [organization](administration/organizations.md) is displayed in the interface header.

   If your organization uses Federated IDs, Experience Cloud allows you to sign in with your organization's single sign-on without being required to enter your email address and password. Add `#/sso:@domain` to the Experience Cloud URL (`https://experience.adobe.com`) to accomplish this task.
    
   For example, for an organization with Federated IDs and the domain `adobecustomer.com`, set your URL link to `https://experience.adobe.com/#/sso:@adobecustomer.com`. You can also go directly to a specific application by bookmarking this URL, appended with the application path. (For example, for Adobe Analytics, `https://experience.adobe.com/#/sso:@adobecustomer.com/analytics`.)

## Access Experience Cloud applications {#navigation}

After signing in to Experience Cloud, you can quickly access all your applications, services, and organizations from the unified header.

To access Experience Cloud applications and services provisioned for you within your organization, go the application selector ![menu](assets/apps-icon.png).

You can also submit open-ended feedback and create prioritized support tickets.
