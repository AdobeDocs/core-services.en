# Agentic AI in Experience Cloud products

Agentic AI refers to systems that operate as autonomous agents. These agents can make decisions on their own, adapt, and take initiative. This type of AI contrasts with [generative AI](generative-ai.md), which only responds to your input prompts.

You can use Adobe's agentic framework to increase your creativity, connection, and innovation and deliver experiences faster and with greater impact.
