# Agentic AI in Experience Cloud

Adobe Experience Platform Agent Orchestrator and the Platform Agents enable agentic capabilities within our solutions. You can gain access to the capabilities of AEP Agent Orchestrator and AEP Agents either through::

* **Existing [!DNL Experience Cloud] apps:** These apps work on their own, but adding [!DNL AEP Agents] gives you extra power and impact. If you have a license for [!DNL Platform Agent Orchestrator], you can use the [!DNL Platform Agents] for the apps you're entitled to.

* **AI-first Experience Cloud apps:** These apps are built with AI at the core. They use generative or agentic AI for key tasks, and the agentic features are already included in the application license without requiring the Agent Orchestrator add-on. AI-first apps are marked with <b>*</b>.
