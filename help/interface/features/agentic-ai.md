# Agentic AI in Experience Cloud products

AI agents ("agentic AI") in [!DNL Experience Cloud] help turn your goals into clear steps, making hard tasks easier while keeping you in control.

[!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Agent Orchestrator] and [!DNL Platform Agents] bring these AI abilities into our solutions. You can use them in two ways:

* **Existing [!DNL Experience Cloud] apps:** These apps work on their own, but adding [!DNL AEP Agents] gives you extra power and impact. If you have a license for [!DNL Platform Agent Orchestrator], you can use the [!DNL Platform Agents] for the apps you're entitled to.

* **AI-first Experience Cloud apps:** These apps are built with AI at the core. They use generative or agentic AI for key tasks, and the agentic features are already included in the license.
