# AI in Experience Cloud products

This page helps you learn which products support generative AI, [!DNL AI Assistant], and whether ADobe Firefly is compatible. You can also find links to product-specific help resources on how to use AI in Experience Cloud.

**About Generative AI**

Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that does more than simply answer questions. It can _create_ content and _generate a response_ to your questions or statements (known as _prompts_).

* **Create:** AI's ability to generate content (text, images, music, or videos) from scratch, based on its training and input prompts. This ability is the _generative_ aspect of generative AI.

* **Generate a response:** AI's providing an answer or reaction to a prompt, typically drawing on its available data and knowledge repositories.

With generative AI, you can gain product knowledge quickly if you're new to Experience Cloud. Seasoned users can discover operational insights in seconds rather than hours.

**What is [!DNL AI Assistant]?**

[!DNL AI Assistant] is a conversational tool supported in Experience Platform and related applications. These applications use it similarly but with product-specific advantages. Use it to accelerate your workflows, improve your product knowledge, troubleshoot problems, or search through information and find operational insights. In certain applications, [!DNL AI Assistant] lets you discover operational insights immediately. 

**Product Knowledge:** Product knowledge refers to concepts and topics grounded in Experience League documentation. Responses from Experience League are verifiable and cited with links. Learn about the types of [objective-based prompts](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/ai-assistant/home) to get the most out of [!DNL AI Assistant].

**Operational Insights:** Operational insights refer to answers AI Assistant generates about your meta data objects (attributes, audiences, dataflows, datasets, destinations, journeys, schemas, and sources), including counts, lookups, and lineage impact.

<!-- **Your data remains yours**

In AI Assistant, security is the priority:

* Customer data is not used to train language models.
* AI Assistant looks at only the documents that you tell it to. You are in control.
* Your people can use AI Assistant only on documents they can access.
* It's audit-ready: Responses are attributable to source documents.
* Enterprise controls are in place to manage who has AI access in the company. -->
