**What is genAI?**

Generative AI is a type of AI that can create original content. For example, it can create text, images, video, audio, or software code in response to a user's prompt or request.

* **Create:** The ability to generate content (text, images, music, or videos) from scratch, based on its training and input prompts. This ability is the _generative_ aspect of generative AI.

* **Generate a response:** AI provides an answer or reaction to a prompt, typically drawing on its available data and knowledge repositories.
