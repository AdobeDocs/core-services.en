# Generative AI in Experience Cloud products

Generative AI (genAI) in Experience Cloud helps you automate creative and cognitive tasks and enhance productivity. This page describes where Experience Cloud applications support genAI and AI Assistant, and provides links to learn more about these features.

**What is genAI?**

Generative AI is a type of AI that can create original content. For example, it can create text, images, video, audio, or software code in response to a user's prompt or request.

* **Create:** The ability to generate content (text, images, music, or videos) from scratch, based on its training and input prompts. This ability is the _generative_ aspect of generative AI.

* **Generate a response:** AI provides an answer or reaction to a prompt, typically drawing on its available data and knowledge repositories.

**What is [!DNL AI Assistant]?**

[!DNL AI Assistant] is a conversational tool supported in Experience Platform and related applications. Use it to quicktly gain _product knowledge_ and _operational insights_ in supported products.

* **Product knowledge:** Product knowledge refers to concepts and topics grounded in Experience League documentation. Learn how to create effective, [objective-based prompts](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/ai-assistant/home) to get the most out of [!DNL AI Assistant]. All responses from Experience League are verifiable and cited with links.

* **Operational insights:** [Operational insights](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/ai-assistant/questions#objects-questions) refer to generated responses about your metadata objects (attributes, audiences, dataflows, datasets, and so on). With [!DNL AI Assistant], you can accomplish in seconds what otherwise might take hours or days.

* **Customer support**: The [Product Support Agent](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/ai-assistant/new-features/customer-support) is a self-serve debugging and troubleshooting capability of [!DNL AI Assistant] that you can use for Experience Platform features and applications. Troubleshoot support issues without leaving your workflows, create customer support tickets, and track case progress using AI Assistant. 

    **Note:** This feature is in Alpha and may not be available to your organization. To participate in the Alpha program and access this feature, contact your Adobe Account Team.
