# About first-party cookies

Analytics uses cookies to provide information on variables and components that do not persist between image requests and browser sessions. These harmless cookies originate from a domain hosted by Adobe, known as third-party cookies.

Many browsers and anti-spyware applications are designed to reject and delete third-party cookies, including those used in Analytics data collection. In order to circumvent tracking limitations imposed by browsers and programs, you can implement first-party cookies.

Two options are available to implement first party cookies

* The Experience Platform ID Service. The ID Service can set the cookie in the first-party context using JavaScript.
* DNS entries on your companies DNS server.
* If your site has secure pages using the `https://` protocol and you are not using the Experience Platform ID Service, you can work with Adobe to obtain an SSL certificate in order to implement first-party cookies

The SSL certificate issuance process can often be confusing and time consuming. As a result, Adobe established a partnership with DigiCert, an industry leading Certificate Authority (CA), and developed an integrated process by which the purchase and management of these certificates is automated.

With your permission, we will work with our CA to issue, deploy, and manage a new SHA-2 SSL certificate for you. Adobe will continue to manage this certificate and ensure that an unexpected expiration, revocation, or security concern, does do not threaten the availability of your organizations secure collection.
