The tool allows administrators to streamline user provisioning, updates, and deactivation across Adobe products. 

  The User Sync Tool enables organizations to simplify managing user accounts and licenses by automatically syncing user data (such as roles, groups, and access permissions) between their directory service and Adobe systems. This tool is particularly useful for enterprises with large teams. It helps to maintain consistency and security while ensuring that users have access only to the products and services to which they are entitled.
