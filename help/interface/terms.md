|Audiences|In Creative Cloud, an audience can be the person viewing a video.|In the Experience Cloud, Audiences are collections of people that you can target in campaign activities.<br>The membership in an audience can be determined based on a set of rules, operating on the visitor's Context, or based on a fixed list.
