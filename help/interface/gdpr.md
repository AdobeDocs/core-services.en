# [!DNL Customer Attributes] support for General Data Protection Regulation

This page describes how [!DNL Customer Attributes] supports General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

>[!IMPORTANT]

>The contents of this document are not legal advice or meant to substitute for legal advice. Consult with your legal counsel for advice concerning GDPR.

The [General Data Protection Regulation](https://business.adobe.com/privacy/general-data-protection-regulation.html), a law in effect May 25, 2018, gives all individuals (data subjects) within the borders of the European Union (EU) control of their personal data. It also simplifies the regulatory environment for international business. This law applies to all businesses (data controllers) that offer goods or services to, monitor the behavior of, or collect personal data from individuals within the borders of the EU at the time their personal data is processed, regardless of the data controller's business location.

Adobe Experience Cloud acts as a data processor for any personal data it receives and stores on behalf of its customers. As a data controller, you determine the personal data that Adobe Experience Cloud processes and stores on your behalf.

This document describes how [!DNL Customer Attributes] supports your data subjects' GDPR data access and deletion rights using the Adobe Experience Platform Privacy Service API and Privacy Service UI.

For more information about what GDPR means for your business, see [GDPR and Your Business](https://business.adobe.com/privacy/general-data-protection-regulation.html).
