1. Continue by adding comments on the shared asset:

   In Creative Cloud, you can select into an image, then select **[!UICONTROL Activity]** to add a comment on the image. Comments are synced on the assets in the [!DNL Creative Cloud] and [!DNL Experience Cloud].

   In Experience Cloud, select into an image, then select the time-line icon to add a comment on the image. Comments are synced on the assets in the Creative Cloud and Experience Cloud.

 1. To unshare a folder, select **[!UICONTROL Share Using Creative Cloud]** (similar to [Step 3](t-share-creative-cloud.md#step_BA17CFA185284641A9B878BA29551996)), then remove users by selecting X, then select **[!UICONTROL Share]**.

   Once you have removed all Creative Cloud Users, the folder is unshared and the Creative Cloud users no longer has access. 

More ways to use a shared asset include: 

* Use assets in the [!UICONTROL Asset Selector] in [!DNL Adobe Social] for social posts.
* Load or swap assets in the [Offers Library](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/experiences/offers/manage-content.html?lang=en) in [!DNL Adobe Target] for images in activities.

After you share a folder to the Creative Cloud, you will see the Creative Cloud logo on the folder.
