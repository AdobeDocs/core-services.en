+ `TOC.md` at the root of your user guide provides the organization of the user guides that are contained in this solution. 
+ Each User Guide will have it's own unique `TOC.md`
+ The first page of each user guide is called `overview.md`
+ Each topic in the user guide has it's own distinct directory.
    + If there is a topic in the guide called *Implementation*, the corresponding directory is `/implementation`
+ All image assets are stored in `/assets` at the root of the user guide.
    + All images in the `/assets` directory will be localized.
    + Any images in the `/no-localize` directory will not be localized (there's a surprise!). This can be used to ensure in loc versions that specific assets aren't reproduced unnecessarily.
