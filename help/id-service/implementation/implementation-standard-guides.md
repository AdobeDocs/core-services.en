# Implementation Guides

Instructions and code samples for standard and non-standard implementations of the Experience Cloud ID service.

# Standard Implementation

A standard implementation uses Dyanamic Tag Manager \(DTM\) to help you get started with the ID service and integrate it with other Experience Cloud solutions. We **strongly recommend** that you use DTM when implementing the ID service. To get started, see [Standard Implementation with DTM](mcvid-standard.html#).

# Non-Standard Implementations

These procedures and code samples can help you set up the Experience Cloud ID service in a manual, or non-standard manner. Please note that these implementations are often technically challenging and complex. They can require scarce engineering resources on your part or consume contracted support time with your Adobe consultant.

>[!NOTE]
>As an alternative, we recommend using DTM to implement the ID service. DTM streamlines the implementation workflow and automatically ensures the correct code placement and sequencing. Additionally, DTM puts you on the recommended implementation path for the ID service and subsequent integrations with other Experience Cloud solutions.

See the index below for a list of common implementation paths.

# Index of Implementation Guides

+ **[Standard Implementation with DTM](implementation-standard/standard.md)**  
A standard implementation uses Dynamic Tag Management \(DTM\) to set up, deploy, and integrate the Experience Cloud ID service with your other Experience Cloud solutions. DTM is the preferred and recommended implementation tool because it helps simplify complex tag management tasks and automates code placement. The standard implementation information and procedures in this section will help you set up the ID service with DTM.
+ **[Implement the Experience Cloud ID Service for Analytics](implementation-solution-specific/implementation-solution-specific-analytics.md)**  
 These instructions are for Analytics customers who want to use the Experience Cloud ID service and do not use Dynamic Tag Management \(DTM\). However, we strongly recommend that you use DTM to implement the ID service. DTM streamlines the implementation workflow and automatically ensures the correct code placement and sequencing.
+ **[Implement the Experience Cloud ID Service for Target](implementation-solution-specific/implementation-solution-specific-target.md)**
 These instructions are for Target customers who want to use the Experience Cloud ID service and do not use Dynamic Tag Management \(DTM\). However, we strongly recommend that you use DTM to implement the ID service. DTM streamlines the implementation workflow and automatically ensures the correct code placement and sequencing.
+ **[Implement the Experience Cloud ID Service for Analytics and Audience Manager](/implementation-solution-specific/implementation-solution-specific-aam-analytics.md)**
These instructions are for Analytics and Audience Manager customers who want to use the Experience Cloud ID service and do not use Dynamic Tag Management \(DTM\). However, we strongly recommend that you use DTM to implement the ID service. DTM streamlines the implementation workflow and automatically ensures the correct code placement and sequencing.
+ **[Implement the Experience Cloud ID Service for Analytics, Audience Manager, and Target](/implementation-solution-specific/implementation-solution-specific-aam-analytics-target.md)**
These instructions are for Analytics, Audience Manager, and Target customers who want to use the Experience Cloud ID service and do not use Dynamic Tag Management \(DTM\). However, we strongly recommend that you use DTM to implement the ID service. DTM streamlines the implementation workflow and automatically ensures the correct code placement and sequencing.
+ **[Server-Side Implementation of the Experience Cloud ID Service](implementation-other/implementation-other-setup-server-side.md)**
These instructions are for A4T customers with mixed server- and client-side implementations of Target, Analytics, and the ID service. Customers who need to run the ID service in a NodeJS or Rhino environment should also review this information. This instance of the ID service uses a shortened version the `VisitorAPI.js` code library, which you download and install from Node Package Manager \(NPM\). Review this section for installation instructions and other configuration requirements.
+ **[Direct Integration with the Experience Cloud ID Service](implementation-other/implementation-other-direct-integration.md)**
This implementation lets customers use the ID service on devices that cannot accept or work with our JavaScript or SDK code. This includes devices such as gaming consoles, smart TVs, or other Internet-enabled appliances. Refer to this section for syntax, code samples, and definitions.
+ **[Direct Integration Use Cases](implementation-other/implementation-other-direct-integration-examples.md)**
These examples cover 2 common use cases related to a direct integration and the Experience Cloud ID \(MID\). The MID is a unique, persistent ID for your site visitors.
