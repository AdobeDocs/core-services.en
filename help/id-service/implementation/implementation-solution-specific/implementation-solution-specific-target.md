# Implement ID Service for Target

These instructions are for Target customers who want to use the Experience Cloud ID service and do not use Dynamic Tag Management \(DTM\). However, **we strongly recommend** that you use DTM to implement the ID service. DTM streamlines the implementation workflow and automatically ensures the correct code placement and sequencing.

>[!NOTE]
>
>+ [Read the requirements](../../reference/reference-requirements.md) before you begin.
>+ Configure and test this code in a development environment before implementing it in production.

## Step 1: Get the ID Service Code

The ID Service requires the `VisitorAPI.js` code library. Contact [Customer Care](https://helpx.adobe.com/marketing-cloud/contact-support.html) to get this code.

## Step 2: Add the Visitor.getInstance Function to the ID Service Code

### Part 1: Copy the Visitor.getInstance function below** 

```javascript
var visitor = Visitor.getInstance("INSERT-MARKETING-CLOUD-ORGANIZATION ID-HERE");
```

### Part 2: Add function code to the VisitorAPI.js file** 

Place the `Visitor.getInstance` function at the end of the file after the code block. Your edited file should look like this:

```javascript
/*
========== DO NOT ALTER ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE ==========
Version and copyright section
*/

// Visitor API code library section

// Put Visitor.getInstance at the end of the file, after the code library

var visitor = Visitor.getInstance("INSERT-MARKETING-CLOUD-ORGANIZATION ID-HERE");
```

## Step 3: Add Your Experience Cloud Organization ID to Visitor.getInstance <a id="step3"></a>

In the `Visitor.getInstance` function, replace `INSERT-MARKETING-CLOUD-ORGANIZATION ID-HERE` with your Experience Cloud organization ID. If you do not know your organization ID, you can find it on the Experience Cloud administration page. See also, [Administration - Core Services](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcloud/admin_getting_started.html). Your edited function could look similar to the example below.

`var visitor = Visitor.getInstance("1234567ABC@AdobeOrg");`

>[!CAUTION]
>
>*Do not* change the case of the characters in your organization ID. The ID is case-sensitive and must be used exactly as provided.

## Step 4: Add Visitor API Code to the Page

Deploy the `VisitorAPI.js` file to your site in the `<head>` tags before the reference to the `mbox.js` file. The Experience Cloud ID service must execute before the first Target network call is generated. 

Move this code into production after testing and verification.

## Step 5: Test and Deploy ID Service Code

### Procedure - Test and Verify

To test your ID service implementation:

+ Check for the AMCV cookie in the domain where your page is hosted.
+ Verify `mboxMCGVID` appears in your Target request and that it contains the Experience Cloud ID \(MID\).

See [Cookies and the Experience Cloud ID Service](../../getting-started/getting-started-cookies.md) for information about the AMCV cookie and the MID.

### Deploy

Deploy your code after it passes testing.
