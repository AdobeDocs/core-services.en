# Implement the Experience Cloud ID Service for Analytics, Audience Manager, and Target

These instructions are for Analytics, Audience Manager, and Target customers who want to use the Experience Cloud ID service and do not use Dynamic Tag Management \(DTM\). However, **we strongly recommend** that you use DTM to implement the ID service. DTM streamlines the implementation workflow and automatically ensures the correct code placement and sequencing.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Read the ID service [requirements](../../reference/reference-requirements.md) before you begin and note the following requirements that are specific to this implementation:
>+ Customers using `s\_code` cannot complete this procedure. Upgrade to `mbox code v61` to complete this procedure.
>+ Configure and test this code in a development environment *before* implementing it in production.

## Step 1: Plan for Server-side Forwarding

In addition to the steps described here, customers who use Analytics and Audience Manager should migrate to server-side forwarding. Server-side forwarding lets you remove `DIL` \(Audience Manager's data collection code\) and replace it with the [Audience Management Module](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/c_profiles_audiences.html). See the [server-side forwarding documentation](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/ssf.html) for more information.

Migrating to server-side forwarding requires planning and coordination. This process involves external changes to your site code and internal steps that Adobe must take to provision your account. In fact, many of these migration procedures need to happen in parallel and get released together.

Your implementation path should follow this sequence of events:

1. Work with your Analytics and Audience Manager contacts to plan your ID service and server-side forwarding migration. Make selecting a tracking server an important part of this plan.
1. Get provisioned for Profiles & Audiences. Complete the form on the [integrations and provisioning site](https://adobe.allegiancetech.com/cgi-bin/qwebcorporate.dll?idx=X8SVES) to get started.
1. Implement the ID service and the Audience Management Module simultaneously. To work properly, the Audience Management Module \(server-side forwarding\) and the ID service must be released for the same set of pages and at the same time.

## Step 2: Download the ID Service Code

The ID Service requires the `VisitorAPI.js` code library. To download this code library:

1. Go to **Admin \> Code Manager**.
1. In Code Manager, click either **JavaScrpt \(New\)** or **JavaScript \(Legacy\)**. This downloads compressed code libraries.
1. Decompress the code file and open the `VisitorAPI.js` file.

## Step 3: Add the Visitor.getInstance Function to the ID Service Code

>[!NOTE]
>+ Previous versions of the ID service API placed this function in a different location and required a different syntax. If you are migrating from a version prior to [version 1.4](mcvid-notes-2015.html#section_F5C596F355B14DA28F45C798DF513572), note the new placement and syntax documented here.
>+ Code in ALL CAPS is a placeholder for actual values. Replace this text with your Organization ID, tracking server URL, or other named value.

### Part 1: Copy the Visitor.getInstance function below

```javascript
var visitor = Visitor.getInstance("INSERT-MARKETING-CLOUD-ORGANIZATION ID-HERE", {
     trackingServer: "INSERT-TRACKING-SERVER-HERE", // same as s.trackingServer
     trackingServerSecure: "INSERT-SECURE-TRACKING-SERVER-HERE", // same as s.trackingServerSecure

     // To enable CNAME support, add the following configuration variables
     // If you are not using CNAME, DO NOT include these variables
     marketingCloudServer: "INSERT-TRACKING-SERVER-HERE",
     marketingCloudServerSecure: "INSERT-SECURE-TRACKING-SERVER-HERE" // same as s.trackingServerSecure
});
```

### Part 2: Add function code to the Visitor API.js file

Place the `Visitor.getInstance` function at the end of the file after the code block. Your edited file should look like this:

```javascript
/*
========== DO NOT ALTER ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE ==========
Version and copyright section
*/

// Visitor API code library section

// Put Visitor.getInstance at the end of the file, after the code library

var visitor = Visitor.getInstance("INSERT-MARKETING-CLOUD-ORGANIZATION ID-HERE", {
     trackingServer: "INSERT-TRACKING-SERVER-HERE", // same as s.trackingServer
     trackingServerSecure: "INSERT-SECURE-TRACKING-SERVER-HERE", // same as s.trackingServerSecure

     // To enable CNAME support, add the following configuration variables
     // If you are not using CNAME, DO NOT include these variables
     marketingCloudServer: "INSERT-TRACKING-SERVER-HERE",
     marketingCloudServerSecure: "INSERT-SECURE-TRACKING-SERVER-HERE" // same as s.trackingServerSecure
});
```

## Step 4: Add Your Experience Cloud Organization ID to Visitor.getInstance

In the `Visitor.getInstance` function, replace `INSERT-MARKETING-CLOUD-ORGANIZATION ID-HERE` with your Experience Cloud organization ID. If you do not know your organization ID, you can find it on the Experience Cloud administration page. Your edited function could look similar to the example below.

`var visitor = Visitor.getInstance("1234567ABC@AdobeOrg", { ...`

>[!NOTE]
>*Do not* change the case of the characters in your organization ID. The ID is case-sensitive and must be used exactly as provided.

## Step 5: Add Your Tracking Servers to Visitor.getInstance

Analytics uses tracking servers for data collection.

### Part 1: Find your tracking server URLs

Check your `s_code.js` or `AppMeasurement.js` files to find the tracking server URLs. You'll want the URLs specified by these variables:

+ `s.trackingServer`
+ `s.trackingServerSecure`

### Part 2: Set tracking server variables

To determine which tracking server variables to use:

1. Answer the questions in the decision matrix below. Use the variables that correspond to your answers.
1. Replace the tracking server placeholders with your tracking server URLs.
1. Remove unused tracking server and Experience Cloud server variables from the code.

![](../../assets/tracking-server-matrix.png)

>[!NOTE]
>When used, match the Experience Cloud server URLs to their corresponding tracking server URLs like this:
>+ Experience Cloud server URL = tracking server URL
>+ Experience Cloud server secure URL = tracking server secure URL
>If you're not sure how to find your tracking server see the [FAQ](../../faqs/faqs-id-service.md) and [Correctly Populate the trackingServer and trackingServerSecure variables](https://helpx.adobe.com/analytics/kb/determining-data-center.html).

## Step 6: Update Your AppMeasurement.js File

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This step requires `AppMeasurement`. You cannot continue if you're still using `s\_code`.

Add the `Visitor.getInstance` function shown below to your `AppMeasurement.js` file. Place it in the section that contains configurations such as `linkInternalFilters`, `charSet`, `trackDownloads`, etc. :

`s.visitor = Visitor.getInstance("INSERT-MARKETING-CLOUD-ORGANIZATION ID-HERE");`

>[IMPORTANT]
>At this point, you should remove the Audience Manager DIL code and replace it with the Audience Management Module. See [Implement Server-Side Forwarding](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/ssf.html) for instructions.

 ** *\(Optional, but recommended\)* Create a custom prop**

Set a custom prop in `AppMeasurement.js` to measure coverage. Add this custom prop to the `doPlugins` function of your `AppMeasurement.js` file:

```javascript
// prop1 is used as an example only. Choose any available prop.
s.prop1 = (typeof(Visitor) != "undefined" ? "VisitorAPI Present" : "VisitorAPI Missing");
```

## Step 7: Add Visitor API Code to the Page

Place the `VisitorAPI.js` file within the `<head>` tags on each page. When you the `VisitorAPI.js` file to your page:

+ Put it at the beginning of the `<head>` section to it appears before other solution tags.
+ It must execute before `AppMeasurement` and the code for other Experience Cloud solutions.

## Step 8: *\(Optional\)* Configure a Grace Period

If any of these use cases apply to your situation, ask [Customer Care](https://helpx.adobe.com/marketing-cloud/contact-support.html) to set up a temporary [grace period](../../reference/reference-analytics/reference-analytics-grace.md). Grace periods can run for up to 180-days. You can renew a grace period if required.

### Partial Implementation Use Case

You need a grace period if you have some pages that use the ID service and some pages that do not, and they all report into the same Analytics report suite. This is common if you have a global report suite that reports across domains.

Discontinue the grace period after the ID service is deployed on all your web pages that report into the same report suite.

### s\_vi Cookie Requirements

You need a grace period if you require new visitors to have an `s\_vi` cookie after migrating to the ID service. This is common if your implementation reads the s\_vi cookie and stores it in a variable.

Discontinue the grace period after your implementation can capture the MID instead of reading the `s\_vi` cookie.

See also, [Cookies and the Experience Cloud ID Service](../../getting-started/getting-started-cookies.md).

### Clickstream Data Integration

You need a grace period if you send data to an internal system from a Clickstream data feed and that processes uses the `visid_high` and `visid_low` columns.

Discontinue the grace period after your data ingestion process can use the `post_visid_high` and `post_visid_low` columns.

See also, [Clickstream Data Column Reference](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/clickstream/datafeeds_reference.html).

## Step 9: Testing and Verification

The Experience Cloud solutions in this implementation return IDs in the form of key-value pairs. Each solution uses different keys \(e.g., the Analytics `SDID` vs the Target `mboxMCSDID`\) to hold the same ID. To test your implementation, load your pages in a development environment. 

Use your browser console or software that monitors HTTP requests and responses to check the IDs listed in the following table. The ID service has been implemented correctly when the key-value pairs listed below return the same ID values.

>[!NOTE]
>You can use the [Adobe Debugger](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/implement/?f=debugger.html) or the [Charles HTTP proxy](https://www.charlesproxy.com/) to check for these solution-specific IDs. However, you should feel free to use whatever tool or debugger works best for you.

### Test and Verify for all solutions

Check for the:

+ [AMCV cookie](../../getting-started/getting-started-cookies.md) in the domain where you page is hosted.
+ Experience Cloud ID \(`MID`\) with the Adobe debugger or your preferred debugging tool.

For additional checks that help you determine if the ID service is working properly, see [Test and Verify the Experience Cloud ID Service](../../implementation/implementation-standard/test-verify.md).

### Test and Verify for Analytics

Check for the `SDID` identifier in the JavaScript request. The Analytics `SDID` should match the Target `mboxMCSDID`.

If your tests return an `AID`, that indicates either of the following:

+ You're a returning visitor in the process of migrating legacy Analytics IDs.
+ You have a [grace period](../../reference/reference-analytics/reference-analytics-grace.md) enabled.

When you see an `AID`, check its value against the Target `mboxMCAVID`. These values are identical when the ID service has been implemented correctly.

### Test and Verify for Audience Manager

To test server-side forwarding, see:

+ [How to Determine if Your Account is Ready to Receive Forwarded Data](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/ssf-success.html)
+ [How to Determine if Your Account is not Ready to Receive Forwarded Data](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/ssf-fail.html)

### Test and Verify for Target

Check for the:

+ `mboxMCGVID`
+ `mboxMCSDID` \(The `mboxMCSDID` should match the Analytics `SDID`.\)

If your tests return an `mboxMCAVID`, that indicates either of the following:

+ You're a returning visitor in the process of migrating legacy Analytics IDs.
+ You have a grace period enabled.

When you see an `mboxMCAVID`, check its value against the Analytics `AID`. These values are identical when the ID service has been implemented correctly.

## Step 10: Deployment

Deploy your code after it passes testing.

If you enabled a grace period:

+ Ensure the Analytics ID \(AID\) and MID are in the image request.
+ Remember to disable the grace period once you meet the [criteria for discontinuation](mcvid-setup-aam-analytics-target.html#section_ACEACDB7D5794F25AC6FF46F82E148E1).
