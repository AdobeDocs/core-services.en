# Standard Implementation with DTM: An Overview

A standard implementation uses Dynamic Tag Management \(DTM\) to set up, deploy, and integrate the Experience Cloud ID service with your other Experience Cloud solutions. **DTM is the preferred and recommended implementation tool** because it helps simplify complex tag management tasks and automates code placement. The standard implementation information and procedures in this section will help you set up the ID service with DTM.

## Dynamic Tag Management and the ID Service

[Dynamic Tag Management](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/dtm/) \(DTM\) is the standard deployment tool you should use to configure, deploy, and manage your ID service instance and related Experience Cloud solution integrations. DTM helps simplify the implementation process because it is deeply integrated with the ID service and other Experience Cloud solutions.

Simply add and configure the Experience Cloud ID tool and specify information, such as:

+ Experience Cloud Organization ID \(automatically populated if linked to the Experience Cloud\)
+ Analytics tracking server \(secure and non-secure\)
+ Experience Cloud server \(for first-party tracking servers\)

>[!NOTE]
>
>DTM is available at no charge to any Adobe Experience Cloud customer.

## Getting Started with DTM

DTM is a simple yet powerful tool. If you're not already using it, we strongly encourage you to do so. See the DTM [documentation](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/dtm/c_overview.html) and [DTM Jump Start videos](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/dtm/jump-start-videos.html) to get started with this service. For instructions on how to set up the ID service with DTM, see the information and procedures in the sections below.

+ **[Deployment Guidelines](mcvid-dtm-deployment.html)**
+ **[Implement the Experience Cloud ID Service with DTM](implementation-standard-dtm.md)**
    + Follow these steps to implement the ID service with Dynamic Tag Management \(DTM\).
+ **[Experience Cloud ID Service Settings for DTM](implementation-standard-dtm-settings.md)**
    + Describes the Organization ID, General and Customer Settings fields and how they're used by the Experience Cloud ID service.
+ **[Test and Verify the Experience Cloud ID Service](implementation-standard-test-verify.md)**
    + These instructions, tools, and procedures help you determine if the ID service is working properly. These tests apply to the ID service in general and for different ID service and Experience Cloud solution combinations.
